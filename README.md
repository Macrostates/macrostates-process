# Process specification package

This package describes how specification-driven work should proceed. It is
intended to be reusable across projects.

## Macrostates

This package is part of [Macrostates](https://github.com/orgs/Macrostates), a
project for composing reusable specification packages into specs-driven
development projects.

## Quick reference

This section summarizes rules expanded in the package documents below. Use it
for orientation, but apply the detailed rules in the referenced documents when
doing the work.

Before changing any project file, the implementer must check workflow records
and ensure an open workflow record covers the change. See
[Artifacts](002_artifacts.md) for workflow record structure and
[Execution](003_execution.md) for when and how to use workflow records.

Workflow closure requires explicit definer confirmation, including completion,
abandonment, and supersession. When work appears done, suggest closure and keep
the workflow open until the definer confirms. See [Execution](003_execution.md).

Specification edits stay within the project context of the request. After
committing, inspect other package copies and suggest applicable pulls; obtain
explicit definer approval before updating another context. See
[Execution](003_execution.md) for scope and synchronization rules.

## Core and annexes

This package uses progressive disclosure. Core documents are mandatory reading
at the beginning of each working session because they describe the normal path
and the checks needed before changing files.

Annex documents describe rare branches, recovery procedures, and extended
handling. Read an annex only when a core document says the situation applies.

## Scope

- Core specification-driven development concepts.
- Definer and implementer responsibilities.
- Definer support during process execution.
- Documentation ownership and authority.
- Common workflows and workflow continuity.
- Project scaffolding during specification.
- Workflow execution against specifications.
- Subproject coordination inside a parent project.
- Gaps, decisions, completion checks, and quality expectations.

Project-specific requirements belong in a project package, not here.

## Reading order

Read the core documents in this order:

1. [Concepts](001_concepts.md)
2. [Artifacts](002_artifacts.md)
3. [Execution](003_execution.md)

Conditional annexes:

- [Project state](annex_project-state.md): read when project phase or project
  artifacts appear inconsistent.
- [Conflicts](annex_conflicts.md): read when ambiguity, authority conflict, or
  workflow conflict is found.
- [Exceptions](annex_exceptions.md): read when an `Exception` workflow is
  needed.
